oroborus
Oroborus basically is a really minimalistic window manager, which is about
75kb small on a PowerPC machine and about 63kb on an x86 machine.
"Minimalistic" means that the Oroborus window manager doesn't provide some
things other window managers provide.  So you will need some external tools
also provided by this project.
